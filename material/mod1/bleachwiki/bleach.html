        <h2 id = 'ichi'>Kurosaki Ichigo</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. 
                    Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. 
                    He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.</p>    
                <p>Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about 
                    for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to 
                    wear slim fitting clothes. He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his 
                    name is a homonym for the number. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, 
                    as noted by his sister Karin.When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, 
                    with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō 
                    sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.</p>
                <p>It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including 
                    Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.After training
                    in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends. After 
                    Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.</p>

        <h2 id ='rukia'>Kuchiki Rukia</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Rukia Kuchiki (朽木 ルキア, Kuchiki Rukia) is the current captain of the 13th Division. She formerly served 
                    as lieutenant of the 13th Division under Captain Jūshirō Ukitake. Rukia is the adoptive sister 
                    of Byakuya Kuchiki, a friend of Ichigo Kurosaki, and is married to Renji Abarai.</p>
                <p>Short and petite, 
                    Rukia has light skin and purple eyes. Her hair is black, with several strands of hair always hanging between 
                    her eyes. Byakuya has stated she strongly resembles her sister, Hisana Kuchiki.As a Shinigami of the Gotei 13, 
                    Rukia wears a standard shihakushō. 17 months after Aizen's defeat, Rukia wears her hair cropped into a bob 
                    which hangs about her face. She wears a fingerless white tekkō, similar to Byakuya's, which extend above her 
                    elbows.</p>     
                <p>As a lieutenant, she wears her Division Badge around her uniform's left sleeve, which has been 
                    shortened to just reach her upper arm.Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Rukia's hair is in a style 
                    similar to the time before Aizen's defeat, but much longer. She also now wears a typical captain haori over her usual Shinigami shihakushō.   
                    Twelve years after Yhwach's defeat, Rukia wears her long hair in a sideways ponytail. </p>
